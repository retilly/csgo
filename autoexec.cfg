//================================================== NETWORK
 
    //================================================== RATES
        // RATES ADVANCED NOTE
            // In online FPS games, servers have to simulate the game world constantly. This means calculating positions of objects, players, weapons, grenades, also things like ballistics, blood/damage decals, particle effects/physics. Not only that, but servers must keep track of where these things were, are and will be simultaneously (this is expanded on greatly in the TICKRATE and INTERPOLATION ADVANCED NOTE entries).
            // The servers do this job by calculating everything a certain amount of times per second, the more the better for the most part. A value such as once per second would be a horrendous experience. So, the servers simulate and update the game world in discrete time steps called "ticks". A "tickrate" is a measurement of how many ticks there are per second. So, assuming a base value of 1 second, a tickrate of 128 means the server simulates the world 128 times per second (1 second is 1000 milliseconds, divide this by the tickrate value, 128, and we have a result that tells us the game simulates the world every 7.8125 milliseconds. Whereas, a tickrate of 64, 1000 รท 64, means the game simulates the world every 15.625 milliseconds). 64 has always been the default tickrate on Valve servers, though dedicated servers use 128. Newer games vary wildly, with Valorant using 128, COD Warzone and PUBG reportedly using around 60 and Apex Legends (actually another Source engine game) using 20. Yes, 20.
            // For the most part, a higher tickrate provides a less "laggy", more responsive and truer representation of the game world overall. That said, tickrate is often intentionally limited to reduce instability introduced by a fluctuating tickrate, as well as to reduce CPU and data transmission costs for performance reasons. A lower tickrate, however, increases latency in the synchronization of the game simulation between the server and client, among other things creating what is now infamously called: desync, with such gems as rubber-banding.
            //
            // So in summary, tickrate is a measurement for how many times per second the server simulates and updates the game world, informing the client. 128 is considered by most the gold standard, or even bare minimum, especially in competitive play. Though Valve themselves, and many other developers, have yet to capitulate to the demand and so a value of around 60 is more common.
        cl_updaterate "128" // Maximum number of updates per second the client requests from the server. Refer to the TICKRATE ADVANCED NOTE entry below for more information on this setting (Minimum = 10, Maximum = 128. Default = 64).
        // TICKRATE ADVANCED NOTE
            // The servers internal update rate cannot be exceeded regardless of this settings value. As such, Valve default servers operate at a default tickrate of 64 and so values of 128 will only cause the client to demand more updates than it will actually be possible to receive. However, dedicated servers can and will correctly use a value of 128. Thus, 64 will be the stock setting here to keep compliance and circumvent any potential negative implications. BUT, this value must be changed via the console ingame if connecting to non-Valve dedicated servers operating at a tickrate of 128. This can be done by issuing the following command:
            // cl_updaterate "128"
            // as well as:
            // cl_cmdrate "128"
            // to the console and pressing enter after each line. This will change the value temporarily until the next launch or executing the autoexec.cfg file again.
        cl_cmdrate "128" // Maximum number of updates per second the client attempts to push to the server. This means that a value of 128 for this entry on the default Valve 64 tick servers, would have the client sending updates 128 times per second, wasting the last 64 of them as the server will only take the first 64. Also see the TICKRATE ADVANCED NOTE entry above for more information on the theory here (Minimum = 10, Maximum = 128. Default = 64).
        rate "786432" // The rate at which your client can receive network data in bytes per second. If the server attempts to send data at a higher rate than the value of this entry, this can result in packet loss. In theory, the value of this entry should be the value of your connection bandwidth. For example, to calculate for a connection with a maximum download rate equal to 1 Megabytes per second would be 1 Megabyte = 1024 KBytes so 1024 x 1024 = 1048576 bytes per second. With that, in the rates entry you would add a value of:
        // "1048576"
        // However, in the real world, games won't send data at 1 Mbytes per second, so a lesser value will suffice (Minimum = 20480, Maximum = 786432 [Recommended], Optimal = 128000. Default = 196608), values as follows:
            // 20480 = 160 kbps
            // 128000 = 0.96 Mbps (matches max tickrate)
            // 196608 = 1.5 Mbps
            // 262144 = 2.0 Mbps
            // 327680 = 2.5 Mbps
            // 393216 = 3.0 Mbps
            // 524288 = 4.0 Mbps
            // 786432 = 6+ Mbps
        cl_interpolate "1" // Interpolation (0 = Disabled [Deprecated], 1 = Enabled [Forced at server level]. Default = 1).
        // INTERPOLATION ADVANCED NOTE
            // Interpolation, in this case, is several mechanisms used by the Source engine to make sure the game retains its fluidity. It is measured in seconds (A value of 1 = 1 second or 1000 milliseconds, a value of 0.1 = 100 milliseconds, and so on and so forth). The final value of interpolation itself is determined by dividing the current value of the "cl_interp_ratio" convar by the current value of the "cl_updaterate" convar (cl_interp_ratio รท cl_updaterate = interpolation).
            //
            // If the entities in the game world were only rendered at the positions received by the server (see: TICKRATE ADVANCED NOTE), moving objects and animations would appear choppy. Dropped packets would also cause noticeable jitter. The trick to solve this problem is to go back in time for the rendering, meaning what you see on screen is not necessarily what IS happening but what WAS. This allows for the client itself to ensure players have an overall much smoother experience.
            //
            // So, for example, a "cl_interp_ratio" value equal to 0.1 means your game client will display the data received 100 milliseconds before the last/latest data received. Coupled with an "cl_updaterate" equal to 20, the game client would receive an update every 50 milliseconds (remember interpolation is 1 = 1 second or 1000 milliseconds, so interpolation รท update rate or 1000 รท 20 = 50 milliseconds). So with interpolation equal to 0.1, the client will go back in time 100 milliseconds or 2 updates (50 milliseconds + 50 milliseconds = 100 milliseconds).
        cl_interp_ratio "2" // Sets the interpolation ratio (Minimum = 1, Maximum = 5. Default = 2).
        // INTERPOLATION RATIO ADVANCED NOTE
            //  Ideally, this value should be set to 1 so long as you have a good enough connection, whereas if you expect issues such as high ping or packet loss a value of 2 is the correct choice. BUT, when playing competitively against opponents that have this value set to 2 versus your value of 1, you could technically be at a disadvantage, albeit very slight. As such, the only sensible choice and conclusion is therefore a value of 2. This way the game retains its fluidity, protection against packet loss and isn't at a disadvantage compared to other players. What this means technically, is that you will retain 2000 milliseconds worth of updates (cl_interp_ratio รท cl_updaterate or 2000 รท 64 = 31.250, so 2000ms worth of updates at every 31.250ms or 2000 รท 31.250 = 64 updates per second. For 128 tick servers, for example, cl_interp_ratio รท cl_updaterate or 2000 รท 128 = 15.625, so 2000ms worth of updates at every 15.625ms = 128 updates per second).
            // Now. you might be thinking, and would technically be correct, that a value of 1 would keep only the most recent representation of the simulation, meaning more accurate to the current positions etc and less "overhead". But, thanks to "cl_lagcompensation" this is not as simple as it seems.
        cl_lagcompensation "1" // Perform server side lag compensation of weapon firing events (0 = Disabled, 1 = Enabled. Default = 1).
        // LAG COMPENSATION ADVANCED NOTE
            // Between the representation of the game world that is currently displayed on your monitor and the simulation of the game world currently on the server, there is a HUGE difference. But, don't panic, the server knows the interpolation and ping of each player independently. So, the server can take care of the differences in configuration of each player using this convar.
            // There are times when you shoot that you feel your crosshair was not precisely aiming at another player or where you feel it was but when you shoot he doesn't get hurt or die. The server calculates events as such: current server time - packet latency value - client interpolation value = command execution time. The command execution time means there is a difference between the reception time of updates that you send to the server (the real time of the real world) such as mouse input and the time which it actually occurs ingame (simulated time). To compute this simulated time from the real time, the server takes note of your ping (the round-trip time of the data from client to server) and of your interpolation time, without cl_lagcompensation the disparity between input - output would be even bigger.
            //
            // *At some point, I think I will add a note here delving into the equally deep and thorny topic of localised input latency, such as physical inputs (mouse and keyboard), as well as physical outputs (monitor and audio) and also operating system implications.*
        cl_predict "1" // Perform client-side predictions prior to the server-side calculations (0 = Disabled, 1 = Enabled. Default = 1).
        // PREDICT ADVANCED NOTE
            // This is another mechanism which the engine uses to smooth out the simulation and provide a more fluid experience. With a "cl_predict" value of 1 (meaning input prediction activated), the client will extrapolate the players intervening positions AFTER sending an update to the server of the players input and before receiving a response, technically moving before the server is aware and then correcting it with the next update returned from the server. Which will either continue until the completion of the match or cause rubber-banding.
            // Let's assume a player has a network latency of 150 milliseconds and starts to move forward. The information that the forward key is pressed is stored in a user command packet and sent to the server. There, the user command is processed and the player's character model is moved forward in the game world. This world state change is then transmitted to all clients with the next snapshot update. So the player would see his actual movement with a 150 milliseconds delay after he started walking. This delay applies to all player actions like movement and ballistics etc, and is worsened with higher latencies/packet loss which can result in lag/jitter.
            // A delay between the actual player input and the corresponding visual feedback can create a disjointed and unnatural disconnect that makes it hard to move or aim precisely. Client-side input prediction is a way to remove this delay and let the player's actions feel more instant. Instead of waiting for the server to update the position, the local client just predicts the results of its own user commands which it still sends to the server for processing. As the client runs exactly the same code and rules the server will use to process the user commands, the result should be identical. After the prediction is finished, the local player will move instantly to the new location while the server still sees him at the old place.
